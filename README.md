# Manuscript (with code): Prediction of Liver Diseases using Machine Learning

Thie paper aims to study the application of various Machine Learning models on the dataset of Indian patients carrying liver disease. This is a Classification problem, giving the output of whether the patient contains Liver Disease or not. For this, a variety of parameters, i.e., laboratory test samples have been collected. The results along with the methodology can be found in the paper below.
