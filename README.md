# Manuscript (with code): Prediction of Liver Diseases using Machine Learning

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the use of several machine learning models on a dataset of liver disease patients from India. The outcome of this classification problem is whether the patient has liver disease or not. Numerous parameters, i.e., laboratory test samples, have been gathered for this. The document below contains both the technique and the outcomes.
